# DnD Character Generator

By: Kasper Dissing Bargsteen

## Notes
My primary focus was the code and design came secondary.

I had some issues with the components moving around in an unpredictable manner when using different screen sizes despite them being anchored. I hope it looks fine on your screen as :)

I attempted a drag'n'drop solution for the ability scores, where you could choose, which scores that would go to each ability, but there were some issues with the precision of dropping. I therefore decided to drop it for now (pun intended..).

## Attributions
I created all the artwork using Krita.

My singleton implementation was heavily inspired by [this Wiki.Unity3d.com example.](http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php?title=Singleton&oldid=20231)
